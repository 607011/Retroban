This implementation is minimalist in terms of visual appearance, but not in terms of complexity and variety: You can choose from more 43.000 levels contained in [550 collections](puzzles/list.txt). Difficulties range from fairly easy to bloody hard. If you want to familiarize yourself with the Sokoban game, begin with the collection [LearningSokoban](https://607011.github.io/Retroban/#collection=LearningSokoban;level=1).
